React.js is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It provides a flexible and efficient way to create complex UI components for web applications. With React.js, developers can create reusable components that can be easily updated and maintained.

Blocto is a mobile wallet that allows users to securely manage their digital assets. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for managing cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. Blocto also integrates with various blockchain networks, making it easy to interact with decentralized applications.

IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing files. It is designed to provide a decentralized and distributed system for storing and retrieving data. IPFS is used in the NFT Marketplace to store and distribute NFTs. This ensures that the NFTs are stored securely and can be accessed by anyone on the network.

## To use the NFT Marketplace, users need to connect their Blocto wallet to the platform. Once connected, users can buy and sell NFTs using Flow Testnet's native token, FLOW. All transactions on the marketplace are securely stored on the Flow Testnet blockchain.

## Overall, the NFT Marketplace on Flow Testnet provides a secure and decentralized platform for buying and selling NFTs. Its integration with React.js, Blocto, and IPFS ensures that the marketplace is efficient, user-friendly, and robust.
